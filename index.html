                            <p id="paragraph1">I currently work as a Software Quality Assurance Analyst for Foundation Software, Inc., in Strongsville,
                                Ohio. In testing the software at my workplace, I became interested in learning how to develop
                                the code that I test on a daily basis. I first began my college career at Case Western Reserve
                                University and am now excited to be completing the Full-Stack Web Development bootcamp through
                                CWRU.
                            </p>

                            <p>In warm weather, I enjoy a variety of activities outdoors. I enjoy hiking, kayaking, biking,
                                and jogging. Last spring, I finished my 1st half-marathon. Not a stellar finish-time, but
                                was satisfied to complete the race. I like working in my flowers outside but do not have
                                much of a green thumb. I love traveling and hope to plan a trip overseas in the near future.
                                I also like reading and belong to a bookclub with coworkers. Over the past winter, I have
                                completed several projects around the house, becoming quite proficient at painting. I like
                                the sense of accomplishment I feel when they have been completed.
